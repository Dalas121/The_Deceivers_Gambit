#
# young Delfador is rather needy. He seeks out praise, attention, etc.
#
# Delfador gets his title from mimicing the saurians' "Great One", 
# but he *earns* it when he shows character growth and goes after Eldred
#
# Delfador wields more magic than other mages seen in Wesnoth.
#   part of that is because you don't see the other mages "up close"
#      i.e. when your silver mage gets lucky and dodges 3 attacks in a row, maybe he actually cast "shield"
#   and perhaps other mages focus less on war and more on study - scientists rather than engineers, so-to-speak
#   but on top of that, Delfador's just a magical prodigy. 
#       in addition to his schooling, he's gained a lot of magical knowledge from his experiences with Elende, orcish shamans, Omaranth, etc
#       he's also learned a great deal from his time with Methor (one of the masters at Alduin - quite powerful himself!)
#
# I'm imagining TDG part-1 Delfador to be 20-30, TDG part-2 Delfador to be 45-55, and HttT Delfador to be 60-70
#
# helios.ogg is "Delfador's theme"
#


#
# Garard likes Delfador, and ONLY Delfador
# he's good to his friends, but he only values war-prowess
# in case it's not clear from his recruits, he also has a lot of connections with the mighty horse clans
#

#
# Lionel is a competent general without a ton of personality. He supports the king and is good at his job, and has been for a long time.
# calls Methor "old man"
#

#
# Arand is determinedly loyal to Garard, but not so bloodthirsty. He starts to suspect there's a traitor around the events of S09x,
# which is why Asheviere orders Eldred/Kestrel to have him killed. When Kestrel fails, Eldred sics Delfador on him instead.
# Arand likes recruiting Heavy Infantrymen (and has stats similar to one), and values Mages more than Garard (who only likes charging Horsemen)
#

#
# Asheviere is the driving force behind most of the campaign's events, despite not actually showing up.
# Initially, she tries to use the orcs to kill Garard, culminating in S06.
#
# When that fails, she decides to erode his power-base first. She convinces him (subtly) to send away Lionel in S08x, 
# her necromancer friend (mentioned by Eldred in S13) is responsible for the blackcrest-saurian alliance, dissolved by Delfador in S10
# She's much more involved in raising Eldred than Garard is; Eldred more-or-less serves as her pawn
#

#
# Eldred usually refers to Asheviere as "mother" and Garard as "Garard".
# At first he's nervous; scared of Garard and quiet in his presence.
# Later, as he fights Delfador, he starts to mentally unravel more and more.
# Between Garard's expectations, Asheviere's influence, his parents' hostile relationship,
# and being effectively a child soldier, he's really messed up.
#

#
# The orcish clans spend most of this campaign being manipulated by Asheviere.
# In S06, she is the "spy" Irbirch mentions who proposed the trap, and she's also responsible for the messenger confusion
# (also she's willingly with the orcs at scenario start; not taken prisoner as Methor thinks)
#
# Clan Whitefang makes heavy use of goblins; both goblin spearmen and wolf riders. No shamans.
# Clan Blackcrest makes heavy use of shamans, and also usually appears alongside Saurian allies. No goblins.
